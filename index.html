          <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
           <p>
             HTML is an acronym for the term Hyper Text Mark-up Language. It is a language used to define the structure of a webpage. This simple language is represented with tags, also called elements.</p>
              <p>The language begins with an opening tag and close with a closing tag as shown below.</p>
              <h1>This is a heading</h1>
              <p>Within the opening and closing tags is a page content that will be rendered in a browser.
              HTML uses hypertext to link out to other web pages within and outside the same domain. When a link is within the same domain, it is called internal link.
